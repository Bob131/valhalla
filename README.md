Valhalla
===

Valhalla is a vaguely cross-platform (should work on most unices... maybe)
tool for sharing or archiving files. Currently a WIP.

## Getting started

On RHEL-like systems:

```
dnf copr enable bob131/valhalla
dnf install valhalla
```

## Compiling

```
hub clone Bob131/valhalla
./autogen.sh
make
```
