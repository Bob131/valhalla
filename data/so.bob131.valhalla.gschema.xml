                Valhalla will copy files to their destination with the
                format specified in this field. Special meaning is given
                to the following sequences:
                  * $c - Adler32 checksum of the file
                  * $f - Original file name
                  * $e - Detected file extension
                You can also add in dates, see strftime(1) for details.

            <description>
                When mounting the remote folder, create an index of
                remote checksums and filenames. This allows valhalla to
                include already existing files in checks for file
                duplication etc before upload.
